        "One problem with being a developer is the large number of pull requests we have to review. Sometimes we forget about them or overlook them (or maybe that's just me ;)). That’s why I built Gitbar. Gitbar is a macOS app that helps developers keep track of all their open pull requests in a single view. This will result in a more organized workflow.",
        "The app is easily accessible from the macOS menubar, where a Pull Request icon shows what the amount of Pull Requests are that you still have to look at ;). It doesn’t matter if it is a GitLab, GitHub or Azure account they are all supported. You can even login with multiple accounts."
